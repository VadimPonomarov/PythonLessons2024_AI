# 🎯 Demo Files

This folder contains demonstration files generated during testing and examples.

## 📁 Contents

- **demo_square_*.py** - Example of square drawing code with visual spacing fixes
- **test_*.py** - Various test files for functionality verification
- **example_*.py** - Code examples for documentation

## 🚀 Purpose

These files demonstrate:
- ✅ AI code generation quality
- ✅ Visual spacing improvements for squares
- ✅ Multi-language comment generation
- ✅ Complete working solutions

## 🗂️ Organization

Demo files are kept separate from production generated code to:
- Keep `generated_code/` clean for actual user work
- Provide examples for new users
- Show system capabilities
- Maintain clear project structure

## 🎨 Example: Square Drawing

The demo square file shows the visual improvement:

**Before** (rectangular):
```
*****
*   *
*   *
*****
```

**After** (equal-sided):
```
* * * * *
*       *
*       *
* * * * *
```

**Note**: These are demonstration files only. Your generated code will be saved in `../generated_code/`.
